# Velvet Roast 🥀

A dark, romantic, and brutally honest web application that judges your pickup lines.

## 🌟 Overview

Velvet Roast is a modern web experience where users can submit their best (or worst) pickup lines. Instead of finding love, they will find judgment. An AI personality—cynical, heartbroken, and sharp-tongued—will analyze the pickup line and deliver a roasting critique.

The aesthetic is deep red, dark, and moody, offering a premium user experience with smooth animations and high-quality typography.
